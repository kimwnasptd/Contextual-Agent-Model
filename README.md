# Contextual-Agent-Model
An Agent Model based on RasaNLU with Intent and Context Management

This project aims to create a base model that handles the flow of given intents through contexts, since RasaNLU only provides intent clssification and parameters extraction from a give sentence. An application based on this model is [Linda](https://github.com/kimwnasptd/Linda-Schedule-Manager).

# Features:

* Follow-Up-Intents
* Contexts with Lifespans
* Handling Request of many Users siultaneously
* Customize the Action for each Intent from inside the Agent
